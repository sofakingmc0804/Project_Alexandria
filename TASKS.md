# TASKS.md (Agent-Executable Build Plan)

> **MVP-FIRST RULE**: Build each phase to minimum working state before adding ANY enhancements. No improvements, variants, or "nice-to-haves" until the basic pipeline produces a single 60-min episode from NotebookLM input to mastered audio output.

## Progress Log
> Append new entries just above the end marker. Use `[START YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ] TASK-ID - summary` when work begins and `[FINISH YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ] TASK-ID - summary` when that slice of work is wrapped. Never delete prior lines.

## Conventions
- Repo root has `Makefile`. All steps runnable via make.
- All configs live under `/configs`. Do not hardcode.
- All inputs placed in `/inputs`. All outputs emitted to `/dist`.
- Every task produces files that pass validation before proceeding.
