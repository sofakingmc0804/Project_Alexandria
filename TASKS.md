# TASKS.md (Agent-Executable Build Plan)

> **MVP-FIRST RULE**: Build each phase to minimum working state before adding ANY enhancements. No improvements, variants, or "nice-to-haves" until the basic pipeline produces a single 60-min episode from NotebookLM input to mastered audio output.

## Progress Log
> Append new entries just above the end marker. Use `[START YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ] TASK-ID - summary` when work begins and `[FINISH YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmZ] TASK-ID - summary` when that slice of work is wrapped. Never delete prior lines.

  **Done when**: Guard script fails whenever FINISH entries lack accompanying Remediation Backlog edits.

- [x] GOV-003 Teach guard to analyze working tree and whitelist existing docs.

- [x] GOV-004 Automate guard execution via Makefile target and git hooks.
  **Done when**: `make guard` runs verify_progress.py and a pre-commit hook blocks commits if guard fails.

- [x] GOV-005 Enforce guard automatically on Python interpreter startup.
  **Done when**: `sitecustomize.py` executes the guard (or blocks execution) whenever workspace changes lack an approved snapshot.

- [x] GOV-006 Ship python command wrappers so direct interpreter execution still triggers guardrails.

  **Done when**: Windows users can run `make install-ps-alias` or `python scripts/guard/install_powershell_alias.py` to add python alias to profile; subsequent 'python' commands invoke guard wrapper.

- [x] GOV-008 Create activation scripts that enable guard-aware python in the current shell session.
  **Done when**: Users can source `activate.ps1` (PowerShell), `activate.sh` (Bash), or run `activate.cmd` (CMD) to add repo to PATH and load aliases; comprehensive setup docs in GUARD_SETUP.md explain all enforcement layers and recommended workflows.

- [x] GOV-009 Document realistic constraints and trade-offs for guard activation strategies.
  **Done when**: GUARD_REALITY_CHECK.md clearly explains that "true automatic" requires admin access; provides three practical no-admin approaches with trade-offs and recommendations for each use case.
