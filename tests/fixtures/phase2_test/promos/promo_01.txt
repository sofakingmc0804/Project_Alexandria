Welcome to this episode where we discuss machine learning fundamentals. Today we will explore neural networks and deep learning concepts that are transforming artificial intelligence. Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons in the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes that process information and learn patterns from data.
