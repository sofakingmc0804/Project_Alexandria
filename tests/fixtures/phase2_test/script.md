## Chapter 1

**Alex:** Welcome to this episode where we discuss machine learning fundamentals. Today we will explore neural networks and deep learning concepts that are transforming artificial intelligence. Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons in the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes that process information and learn patterns from data.

**Jordan:** Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and many other fields. It allows computers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Training neural networks requires large datasets and significant computational power. GPUs and specialized hardware have made this more accessible in recent years.

**Alex:** Lets now discuss transformer architectures which have become the foundation for modern language models like GPT and BERT.
